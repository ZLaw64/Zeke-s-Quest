#Zeke's-Quest
This is the blog I was talking about from the Javascript repository. Currently, it is 12.11.2023 and 04:29. 
With only 20 minutes left till my lunch break is over, I decided to just make my boilerplate and my files such as CSS and JS. No javascript have been implemented. Possibly after I wakeup, I will take some inspiration and mess around with it, especially after I do some of my exercises.
Goal in a couple of months, I want to make a website like Brent Jackson. https://jxnblk.com is his website. Beautiful website and super excited for his game.
The thing that really caught my eye was his projects.
